# Setup  Database
## open package manager console
## select DemoProject.Domain as default project.

run command Add-Migration IdentityCreation -context DemoDbContext
after the above command run Update-Database -context DemoDbContext

# Run API
Set DemoProject.Api as Start up project
Run "IIS Express" in Visual Studio


# Future Improvements

## Testing
* Setup NCrunch for realtime Unit Testing
* Setup Automatic Code Coverage report in Pipeline
* More unit test coverage to Reach 100% Coverage, annotate and exclude code that no need to be test
* Write unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability.


## Performance Optimization

* Implement caching strategies to reduce database load.
* Optimize LINQ queries to improve EF performance.
* Use asynchronous programming models to handle I/O-bound operations.
* Minimize data transfer by implementing pagination in API responses.
* Profile and optimize bottlenecks using performance profiling tools.


## Security Enhancements

* Implement robust authentication and authorization (consider using JWT for stateless authentication).
* Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.
* Implement input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
* Regularly update dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
* Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Code Quality and Maintainability

* More static code analytics using Visual Stuido, Resharper, SonarCube
* Make sure all the SOLID principles for better maintainability.
* Implement global error handling and logging for better debugging.
* Document the API using tools like Swagger for better readability and usability.

## Scalability and Reliability

* Design the database schema with scalability in mind (consider future growth).
* Implement a load balancing strategy to distribute traffic evenly.
* Use a microservices architecture if scalability is a major concern.
* Ensure the API can gracefully handle failures (Implement retries, circuit breakers).
* Consider implementing a distributed caching system like Redis.

## Data Access Layer Optimization

* Use EF Core features like lazy loading, eager loading, or explicit loading wisely.
* Regularly update Entity Framework Core to leverage performance improvements.
* Optimize database indexes based on query patterns.
* Consider using stored procedures for complex queries.
* Normalize or denormalize the database schema as appropriate for performance.


## API Design and Best Practices

* Follow RESTful principles for a consistent and intuitive API.
* Use versioning in your API to manage changes gracefully.
* Use appropriate HTTP status codes and response formats.
* Create better error message format
* Keep endpoints focused and avoid making them too granular or too broad.


## DevOps Integration

* Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
* Implement infrastructure as code for consistent deployment environments.
* Monitor and log API usage and errors for proactive maintenance.
* Regularly backup the database and test recovery procedures.
* Review and optimize your deployment strategies (blue-green deployments, canary releases).
